# Lesson 1

## Main Topics
1. **Introduction to the Course**
   * The course is about learning the C programming language in a practical, hands-on way.
   * It is aimed at people who already have some programming experience.

2. **Overview of C**
   * C is an old but still relevant language.
   * It has few core concepts, making it simple in design but challenging to master in practice.
   * C is a compiled language, not interpreted.

3. **First Program: "Hello World"**
   * Writing and understanding the classic `hello_world.c` program.
   * Explaining the purpose of each part of the program.

4. **Compilation Process**
   * Using a C compiler (`cc`, `gcc`, or `clang`) to turn source code into an executable.
   * The role of the output file (`a.out`) and what it contains (machine code plus metadata).
   * Examining assembly output with `-S` and the effects of optimization (`-O2`).
   * How the compiler can replace `printf` with `puts` for efficiency.

5. **Preprocessor and Headers**
   * Explanation of `#include <stdio.h>` and the role of the C preprocessor.
   * Distinction between source files (`.c`) and header files (`.h`).
   * How headers provide function declarations (prototypes) so the compiler knows about functions like `printf`.

6. **Function Prototypes**
   * What a function prototype is and why it is necessary.
   * Difference between a function definition (with body) and a prototype (just declaration).

So, in short: **the lesson introduces the course, explains the basics of C, demonstrates writing and compiling a simple Hello World program, explores compilation and optimization, and introduces the preprocessor, headers, and function prototypes.**
